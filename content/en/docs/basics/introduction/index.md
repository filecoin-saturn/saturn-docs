Welcome to the Saturn Docs site!

## What is Saturn

Saturn is a CDN that accelerates data stored on the Filecoin Network and IPFS. On one side of the network, customers buy fast, low-cost content delivery. On the other side, Saturn node operators earn Filecoin by fulfilling requests.

Content on Saturn is content-addressed. Every piece of content is immutable and every response verifiable.
Crypto-incentives unite, align, and grow the network. Node operators earn Filecoin for accelerating web content and customers get faster content delivery for less.

In time, Saturn will be trustless, permissionless, and inclusive. Anyone can run Saturn software, contribute to the network, and earn Filecoin. The vast majority of the codebase is open source and developed in the public for all of humanity.
